# 4YourInventory

## About the Project

4YourInventory is an extensive inventory management application designed for 4YourBusiness. It provides functionality to keep track of inventory in a database, allowing users to look up items based on their part number, serial number, distributor, and category. Users can also add new products to the database, track sold items, and check if items are listed on eBay. The application provides information on how many items are listed on eBay and the details of those listings.
